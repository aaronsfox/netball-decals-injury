This folder tests out the ability to programmatically generate court layouts using images/diagrams.

Some simplistic screenshots have been taken from Round 1 of 2019's Vixens vs. Firebirds matchup. These screenshots suffer from parallax error and hence may not be the best to base decisions off. Nonetheless we'll do our best in this scenario to create a diagram of the court and decals, and then programatically adopt this into a Python environment for analysis.

Theoretically we can still adapt this process to a scenario where we have a more accurate diagram anyway - but it's important to note that the dimensions in the diagram in this folder are completely estimated from the images. Our estimates are somewhat improved by placing the decals in appropriate visual locations, and then measuring from the accurately scaled illustrator canvas.

The process for converting the diagram to the Python environment will be to simply program the different measurements of decals on the different courts into a script.
